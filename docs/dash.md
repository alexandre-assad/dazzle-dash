# Dash

Dash is a web framework that allows you to build an analytical site with Python. It is mostly used for creating interactive and data-driven dashboards.

## What is Dash?

### Web Application 

Dash allows for quick web applications, dashboards and data visualization.

### Declarative Syntax

Dash is declarative, which means that all components are declarative and can be interacted with in plain python code.

### Component based

Like popular web frameworks like React or Svelte, Dash works with components. It provides a set of reusable components such as graphs, tables, sliders and more.
This allows for quick deployment in exchange for some control and a larger application size. So it is perfect showcase apps or proof of concepts.

### Ploty is native to Dash!

Ploty is a graphic Python graphing library that allows interactive and visually appealing plots. Ploty is natively integrated with dash which makes it really simple with dependencies while shipping.

## Why use Dash?

### Easy to access for python developpers

Python is a popular first language nowadays, so having a quick way to deploy and showcase one's work is practical.
There's also an easier learning curve than most classical web frameworks, in exchange for sustainability.

### Interactivity

Instead of having a chain of promises, asyncs, and whatnot, Dash is equipped with support for Jupyter notebooks.
If one is already able to make an interactive window on a notebook, they should be able to just ship it to the app.

### Open source

Open source software is just a better choice for me as a student. Don't you like something? Just bring up an issue on the public repo or fix it yourself!

### Limited customization

Being free with customization is what everyone wants at first, but in the context of a showcase or a proof of concept.
It prevents the user from getting lost in everything they need to learn.
